line 28-29 and 75-83: Inserting the address by yourself

If you want to insert your address yourseslf, please don't comment line 28-29 and 75-83 but commented on line 72.

For line 28-29, the information should be tested by yourself.

For this coding, I tested what I should input in order to get only one option to choose.
- search_address: your input text
- complete_address: the information that can be searched from the website
